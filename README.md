# 🚀 100 Days of Code: Python (Data Science Edition)

Welcome to my journey! I am committing 100 consecutive days to mastering Python. While this course covers full-stack development, my personal focus is on **leveraging Python for Data Science and Analytics.**

## 🎯 My Goals
- **Master the Fundamentals:** From basic logic to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
- **Data Proficiency:** Use Python to clean, analyze, and visualize complex datasets.
- **Consistency:** Build a daily habit of coding and "building in public."
- **Portfolio Building:** Create 100 projects that demonstrate my growth as a developer.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3
- **Environment:** VS Code / Replit / Jupyter Notebooks
- **Focus Areas:** Data Structures, Logic, Automation, and eventually NumPy/Pandas.



## 💡 Why am I doing this?
As an aspiring **Data Analyst/Data Scientist**, I believe that code is the bridge between raw data and meaningful insights. This repository serves as a "living resume" of my technical progress.
